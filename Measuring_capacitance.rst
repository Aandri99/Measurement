Measuring capacitance
============================

Objective
---------------
In this course, we will learn how to calculate the systematic error of different measurments. For start we will start with simple example of systematic errors in DC systems. Then we will move on to measuring periodic signals and end the course with more complex measurments of fundamental frequencys and harmonics of the signal.
